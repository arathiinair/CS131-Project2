1. static typing
    save types to variables
    check on field initialization
    argument parameters
    return types

2. environment
    use a stack of environments
    push a new environment onto the stack when you enter a new scope (like a let)
    iterate through the stack from newest to oldest when looking for a variable to get its value
    this method implicitly takes care of shadowing for you
    pop the environment off the stack when you leave its scope
